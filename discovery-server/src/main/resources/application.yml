#eureka.instance.hostname -> Specifies the hostname for Eureka server instance meaning ther server runs on the local machine if it set to localhost
#eureka.client -> Configuration the Eureka client behavior
#eureka.client.register-with-eureka -> means this service will not register itself as client in the Eureka server,Typically set to false for Eureka servers (not client).
#eureka.client.fetch-registry: false -> indicates that this service will not fetch the list of services registered in Eureka. Again, this is because it's a Eureka server, not a client
#eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone -> Specifies the Eureka service url where clients can register and retrieve service information.
